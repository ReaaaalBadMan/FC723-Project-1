# Python Seat-Booking Application for Apache Airlines
# -----------------------------------------------------
# This program simulates a seat booking system for an airline.
# The aircraft is divided into two sections:
# - Front Section: Rows 1 to 80 with columns A, B, C (all bookable)
# - Rear Section: Rows 1 to 80 with columns D, E, F 
# - Rows 77-78 in columns D, E, F represent storage areas ("S") and are not bookable.
# All bookable seats are initially free (represented by "F").
# When a seat is booked, its status changes to "R".
# The program displays a menu to allow the user to perform different operations until exit.

# Define the seating layout for the front and rear sections

# Front section: rows numbered 1 through 80 and columns A, B, C.
front_rows = range(1, 81)          # Rows from 1 to 80 for the front section
front_columns = ['A', 'B', 'C']     # Columns A, B, C for the front section

# Rear section: same rows (1 to 80) but columns D, E, F.
rear_rows = range(1, 81)           # Rows from 1 to 80 for the rear section
rear_columns = ['D', 'E', 'F']      # Columns D, E, F for the rear section

# Create a dictionary to store the status of each seat.
# The keys are seat identifiers (e.g., "1A", "3B") and the values represent:
#   "F" for free, "R" for reserved, and "S" for storage (non-bookable).
